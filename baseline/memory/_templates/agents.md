# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

<!-- One-line summary of this repo and the outcome agents should optimize for. -->

## Source of Truth

1. This `AGENTS.md`
2. Repo-local docs (`README.md`, ADRs, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
3. `.zcode/memory/project/tech-stack.md`
4. Code and tests
5. Baseline / external catalogs only when they match this repo's stack or surface

## Stack Snapshot

- **Language:** <!-- e.g. TypeScript, Python, Go -->
- **Runtime / Framework:** <!-- e.g. Node.js CLI, Next.js, React -->
- **Package Manager:** <!-- e.g. npm, pnpm, bun -->
- **Detected Shape:** <!-- CLI / service / frontend / library / mono-repo -->

## Core Coding Contract

<!-- Mandatory for every project. Keep these as concrete repo-local rules, not generic slogans. -->

- Read repo instructions, docs, configs, and nearby code before editing.
- Prefer existing patterns and the smallest correct diff.
- Preserve public APIs, data shapes, migrations, and external side effects unless explicitly approved.
- Do not add dependencies, frameworks, broad refactors, or generated churn unless the task requires them.
- Run the repo's actual relevant formatter/linter/typecheck/test/build commands after meaningful changes.
- Self-review the diff, including untracked files, and remove debug leftovers before completion.
- Report skipped verification with reasons instead of claiming unverified success.

## Selected Guideline Packs

<!-- Fill this from the agent-skills-standard catalog or other exact-match agent-facing sources. Stack packs supplement the core contract; they do not replace it. -->

- **Strong matches:** <!-- exact agent-skills-standard packs used, e.g. javascript/javascript-language -->
- **Medium matches:** <!-- adjacent packs used only when they change behavior -->
- **Ignored packs:** <!-- generic or conflicting packs not used -->

## Stack-Specific Rules

<!-- Translate selected guideline packs into concrete rules for this repo's stack. -->

- <!-- Examples: ESM vs CJS, framework routing rules, DB migration rules, UI accessibility requirements -->
- <!-- Include only rules that would change an agent decision in this repo -->

## Repo-Specific Rules

- <!-- 3-7 short rules that matter here -->
- <!-- Prefer rules that mention actual files, commands, or boundaries -->
- <!-- Keep rules actionable and non-generic -->

## Boundaries / Gotchas

- <!-- Safety, migration, or tooling caveats -->
- <!-- Keep this short and concrete -->

## Verified Commands

- `<!-- command -->`
- `<!-- command -->`
- `<!-- command -->`

## Code Example

```text
<!-- Paste a short example from the actual codebase, not a generic snippet. -->
```

## Synthesis Notes

- **Rule translation:** <!-- what the selected packs changed in practice -->
- **Source notes:**
  - Local wiki: <!-- exact page names -->
  - External catalog: <!-- exact catalog / URL if used -->
- **Open questions:** <!-- what still needs validation? -->
